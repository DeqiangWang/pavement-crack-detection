# pavement-crack-detection
The project is used to share our recent work on pavement crack detection. For the details of the work, the readers are refer to the paper "Feature Pyramid and Hierarchical Boosting Network for Pavement Crack Detection".
You can find the paper in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330244656_Feature_Pyramid_and_Hierarchical_Boosting_Network_for_Pavement_Crack_Detection.

The datasets used in paper and crack detection results on each datasets are stored in https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y9SxmmFVh0xdQR-wdchUmnScuWMJ5_O-.

The code and trained model will be uploaded soon.
